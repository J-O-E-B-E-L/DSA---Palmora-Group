# DSA---Palmora-Group

Another exciting final projects for the DSA program that I have been on for the past 3 months, where I first started my journey of becoming a data analyst. It's an exciting experience for me and I'm just happy to have started this baby steps journey with DSA.

## **Project Topic: Palmora Group HR Analysis**

### *Project Overview*

For this data analysis project, the primary objective is to conduct a data-driven HR analytics review that identifies gender-related disparities within Palmoria Group’s workforce and recommends actionable strategies to foster a more equitable and inclusive workplace.

This simply means to use the provided data to find gender differences in Palmoria Group’s workforce and suggest ways to create a fairer and more inclusive workplace.

### *Data Source*

### *Data Analysis*

### 1. **Gender Distribution in the Organization (by Region and Department)**

#### **Overall Gender Count:**
  - **Total Employees**: 946
  - **Male Employees**: 505
  - **Female Employees**: 441

#### **By Department:**
  - Most departments have a fairly balanced gender ratio.
  - **Legal** and **Accounting departments** have significantly more males.
  - **Marketing** and **Research & Innovation** have more females.

  - **Kaduna**: 165 Females, 196 Males

    Overall, **males slightly outnumber females** across all regions.

### 2. **Ratings Based on Gender**

  - Average Rating: Males (230), Females (190)
  - Good Ratings: Males (73), Females (89)
  - Very Good: Males (49), Females (58)
  - Poor/Very Poor: More males received poor ratings.

    Insight: While males dominate the “Average” category, females outperform in higher ratings like “Good” and “Very Good.” This might indicate performance quality among female staff is stronger where rated fairly.
